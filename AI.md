# AI usage in this code

Did I use AI?  Yeah, for a couple of things:

1. I used it to vibe code an early version of this app.  It was pretty crappy and I didn't understand it and didn't like that I didn't understand it. All the code here now was written ~~entirely~~ OK _mostly_ by hand.
1. I used it to make my code more idiomatic. I suck at this and I'm lazy.
1. I used it to help me grok the `ipaddr` library.  There's a lot in there and having AI explain it to me saved hours of stupid work.
1. Test cases.  I suck at testing so I had AI spin up some basic test cases I could extend but haven't even looked at yet. They seem fine.



I wrote all the code myself. That's the fun part.
