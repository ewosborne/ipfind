# AI usage in this code

Did I use AI?  Yeah, for a couple of things:

1. I used it to help me grok the `ipaddr` library.  There's a lot in there and having AI explain it to me saved hours of stupid work.
1. Test cases.  I suck at testing so I had AI spin up some basic test cases I extended.
1. Goreleaser.  I suck at this part too.



I wrote all the code myself. That's the fun part.
