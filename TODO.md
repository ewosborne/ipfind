TODO handle err and nil, don't be lazy
TODO test cases
TODO print entire routing table https://seancfoley.github.io/IPAddress/ipaddress.html#address-tries
TODO tab completion, however that works

TODO trie computed when I print the output data
		// maybe build the trie here? and also filter via masks?
		// TODO: does trie only make sense with --subnet? longest and exact will both have a single mask
		//. but maybe looking for longest and stopping at some ceiling has merit?
